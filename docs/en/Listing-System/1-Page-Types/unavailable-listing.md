# prprtes Unavailable Listing

## Introduction
This page really should act as placeholder page. It is used to mating site tree integrity for SEO purposes and facilitating the Model Admin. It should not be used to show any listing data. The page type retains all the data from Listing. The init function in the Parent Page type will atomically redirect any visits to the [Unavailable Listing Page](unavailable-listing-page).
