# prprtes  Real-estate Management System (RMS)
This module has been developed by Richard Rudy (rick@designplusawesome.com) as a proprietary system for Real Estate Agents to Manage and Market their listings on their own site.

## Key Concepts
The underlining principle of development is that *Agent Websites are built to sell the Agent and  __not__ the house*. To that end the Agent's own listing should not be pulled from MLS. This makes the Agents own listing look better than the competition.

SEO is important, a real estate site needs way to deal with Sold listings that conforms to both industry regulations and SEO best practices (proper redirects and expired information)
